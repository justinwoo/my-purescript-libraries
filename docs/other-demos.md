# Other Demos

Examples and demos of doing some practical things in PureScript that I don't use for anything personally. Might be interesting to use for some problems you run into.

## [Puchitomato](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-puchitomato)

A small module for a string literal type that guarantees a String value the same as its Symbol parameter. This actually is something that has come up multiple times for me, so maybe using this with Simple-JSON would be good.

## [Chanpon](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Chanpon)

Record-based query building.

## [Ffi-Props](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Ffi-Props)

Library to work with FFI props with row type parameters.

## [Soondubu](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Soondubu)

Chart.js with Union constraints.

## [Dotorimuk](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Dotorimuk)

A Chart.js POC library. Less useful but with some food for thought.
