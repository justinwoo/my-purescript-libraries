# For Everyone

These libraries are going to be useful for basically anyone who touches PureScript.

## [Spacchetti](https://github.com/justinwoo/spacchetti)

Dhall-based configuration for package-sets. An alternative to using [package-sets](https://github.com/purescript/package-sets) (which I also maintain).

## [Simple-Json](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Simple-Json)

Library for serializing JSON automatically for type aliases, especially of record types using row type information. An alternative to the [Argonaut](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-core) libraries.

## [Milkis](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Milkis)

Library for giving you a basically Union-typed interface for `fetch` on Browser and on Node. A simple to use alternative to the [Affjax](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-affjax) library.
