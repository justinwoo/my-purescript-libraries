# Cool things

Cool libraries using types to accomplish very practical things

## [Choco-Pie](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Choco-Pie)

Library for creating cycles of PureScript-Behaviors Events, where you can make individual "drivers" for handling queries for effects and work with a pure "main" function that takes the driver events in as "sources" and outputs "sinks" of queries to the drivers. Similar to Cycle.js

## [Tortellini](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Tortellini)

Library for parsing and decoding INI files to a record type directly.

## [Lenient-Html-Parser](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Lenient-Html-Parser)

A lenient HTML parser, so you can work with a List of Tags parsed. Kind of like TagSoup.

## [Sijidou](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-sijidou)

A library for matching a string into a record of functions of statically known Symbol proxies.

## [Naporitan](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-naporitan)

A library to reflect a record of proxies, so you don't have to repeat it and all.

## [Xiaomian](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-xiaomian)

A library to easily use Naporitan with a record of `SProxy` of keys of a row type.

## [Bibimbap](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-bibimbap)

The flip side of [Chirashi](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-chirashi), simply storing sum type values and retrieving them by using the constructor name as a test value, by using `Generic.Rep` to get constructor names from a sum type definition.

## [Kushiyaki](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-kushiyaki)

Library (for 0.12) for parsing a `Symbol` template and getting a function to parse a `String` into a record.

## [Kushikatsu](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-kushikatsu)

A simple `Variant (Unmatched String) (routes :: # Type)` routing library built on Kushiyaki.

## [Home-Run-Ball](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Home-Run-Ball)

Library for refinements on values using a row type to track validations and automatically apply validations in the row type parameter.

## [Jajanmen](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-jajanmen)

Cool type-safe Symbol query parameterized helper for Node-SQLite3.


## [Gomtang-Basic](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Gomtang-Basic)

Echarts with Union constraints.

## [Record-Extra](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Record-Extra)

Extra generic Record functions. More useful as a reference for how to implement some specific things in your projects.
