# Type level demos

These are largely just demonstrations of what you can do with types in PureScript and not used for things.

## [Hotteok](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Hotteok)

For handling JS Union values. Basically Advanced TypeScript with more truthful qualifiers as a library.

## [Dango](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-dango)

Sized lists using Symbols for keeping track of size using "." Symbols, e.g. "..." for size-3 lists.

## [Kazunoko](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-kazunoko)

Symbol-literal arithmetic for small numbers, e.g. Add "one" "two" "three"

## [Chahan](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Chahan)

Generic Sum and Product into type-level List.

## [Roskis](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-Roskis)

IxMonad for managing a mutated record. Probably you will always want to use Record.Builder or ST-something instead, but this might be interesting for some.

## [La-Galbi](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-La-Galbi)

Type-level path string formatting. You don't really need this with Symbol.Cons now giving you much better ways to do with Record-Format, but you might find this interesting.
