# Codegen-related

These are projects for generating code and types for other languages from PureScript. Again, you can use some of these directly, but you should mostly use them for inspiration.

Many of these are probably out of date slightly. Let me know if you want to use some of these and I can help you upgrade them and learn how they work.
