I'm sorry you clicked on this link. Use the projects as references to what you might do in your own project, but don't expect them to be that useful by themselves.

None of these are made for beginners, so expect to have to refer to <https://github.com/purescript/documentation/> and learn a lot about PureScript before making use of these.
